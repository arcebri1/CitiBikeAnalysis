# Citi Bike Analysis - Tableau

- - -

I used jupyter notebook to clean up the [Citi Bike Data](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data) between 2018-2020 to create a [Tableau Story](https://public.tableau.com/profile/lorena2196#!/vizhome/CitiBikeAnalysis_16114028351290/Dashboard1) that would help visualize the impact of covid on the [New York Citi Bike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citi_Bike) Program.

## Background

The [New York Citi Bike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citi_Bike) Program is the largest bike sharing program in the United States. 

Since 2013, each month bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the [Citi Bike Data](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data) webpage.


## Questions Visualized

* How many trips have been recorded total during the chosen period? Per year?

* What is the average trip duration, nmber of trips and percent difference per month during the chosen period?

* How has the proportion of short-term customers and annual subscribers changed?

* What are the peak hours in which bikes are used during summer months? Winter months?

* What are the top 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? Ending a journey?

* What are the bottom 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? Ending a journey?

* What is the gender breakdown of active participants (Male v. Female)?

* How does the average trip duration change by age?

* Which bikes (by ID) are most likely due for repair or inspection?


**Other visuals:**

* Designed dashboards accompanied with an analysis explaining why a phenomena may be occuring 

* Created a map that plots all bike stations with a visual indication that shows how each station's popularity changes over time to start a journey with zip code data overlaid on top.
